## Stats

 - Speed
 - Intellect

### Pool
Your raw, innate ability. When you use resources it is used from pool
 - Taking damage
 - Applying effort
 - Using skills

### Edge
Knowing how to use what you have.
 - When you need to use from your pool your edge reduces the needed amount.

### Effort
When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply Effort
 - Use from your pool to reduce difficulty.
 - Pay 3 pool points for first level reduction
    - 2 for every level after that.

#### Effort Score
Your effort score decides how much effort you can use on a roll.
Level one characters start with one effort score

#### Effort And Damage
You can use effort to increase damage instead of ease of roll
 - 3 extra damage per level of effort
 - AOE 2 extra damage to all targets
    - Additionally targets that save take 1 damage
    
#### Multiple uses of Effort and Edge
All effort and used count as one within the same action. Examples
 - Using edge to reduce activation cost of skill means you cannot use that edge to reduce cost of applying effort
 - Applying effort to skill roll, means that less effort can be applied to damage
